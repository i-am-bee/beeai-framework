<Steps>
   <Step title="Clone the starter repo">

  Chose your prefered programming language and get started with the BeeAI Framework starter template.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Python
  git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework-py-starter.git
  cd beeai-framework-py-starter
  ```

  ```bash TypeScript
  git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework-ts-starter.git
  cd beeai-framework-ts-starter
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

   <Step title="Install the dependencies">

   If you're using python, make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

  <CodeGroup>

  ```bash Python
  uv sync
  ```

  ```bash TypeScript
  nvm install && nvm use
  npm ci
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Enviorment Variables">

  Create an `.env` file with the contents from `.env.template`

  <CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS/Linux
  cp .env.template .env  
  ```

  ```bash Windows (PowerShell)
  Copy-Item .env.template .env
  ```

  ```bash Windows (CMD) 
  copy .env.template .env 
  ```
  </CodeGroup>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your LLM Backend">

   If you choose to run a local model, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) must be installed and running, with the [granite3.3](https://ollama.com/library/granite3.3) model pulled. If you run into issues, run `ollama list` to verify the model name and ensure `granite3.3` is installed or that your alias points to it.
  
  ```bash shell
  ollama pull granite3.3
  ```

  or

  If you chose to use a hosted model, edit the `LLM_CHAT_MODEL_NAME` in the `.env` file.
  
  ```bash example
  # Examples (pick one that matches your provider/account):
  LLM_CHAT_MODEL_NAME="openai:gpt-5-mini"
  ```

  
  Add your API key for your preferred provider to your `.env` file and uncomment the line.

  ```bash example
  # Examples (pick one that matches your provider/account):
  OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR API KEY"
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Agent">

  This agent is an activity planner that can help you plan your day. Prompt it with your task and location. Exit the loop by typing "q" and enter.
  
  Take a look inside the code file to understand the example agent.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Python
  uv run agent.py
  ```

  ```bash TypeScript
  npm run start src/agent.ts
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

  Congradulations! You've ran your first BeeAI agent.
