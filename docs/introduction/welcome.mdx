**BeeAI Framework** is an open-source framework for building production-grade multi-agent systems. It is hosted by the Linux Foundation under open governance, ensuring transparency, community-driven development, and enterprise-grade stability. 

BeeAI goes beyond simple prompting by providing a lightweight yet powerful approach to reliable agent development, with **built-in constraint enforcement** and rule-based governance that preserves reasoning abilities while ensuring **predictable behavior**.
The BeeAI Framework provides the flexibility and performance needed for scalable AI systems, supporting both **Python** and **TypeScript** with complete feature parity.


## Key Features

| **Feature**               | **Description**                              |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Production Optimization**  | Built-in caching, memory optimization, and resource management for scalable deployment |
| **Agents with Constraints**  | Preserve your agent's reasoning abilities while enforcing deterministic rules instead of suggesting behavior |
| **Dynamic Workflows**     | Use simple decorators to design multi-agent systems with advanced patterns like parallelism, retries, and replanning |
| **Declarative Orchestration**     | Define complex agent systems in YAML for more predictable and maintainable orchestration |
| **Pluggable Observability** | Integrate with your existing stack in minutes with native OpenTelemetry support for real-time monitoring, auditing, and detailed tracing |
| **MCP and A2A Native**      | Build MCP-compatible components, equip agents with MCP tools, and interoperate with any MCP or A2A agent system |
| **Provider Agnostic**      | Supports 10+ LLM providers including Ollama, Groq, OpenAI, Watsonx.ai, and more with seamless switching |
| **Python and TypeScript Support** | Complete feature parity between Python and TypeScript implementations lets teams build with the tools they already know and love |
