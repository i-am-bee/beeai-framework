## üõ†Ô∏è Improvements

- **Streaming** - Better text and tool calls streaming processing and error handling
- **Parallel Tool Calls** - Execute multiple tools simultaneously for better performance
- **Serve Module** - MCP, BeeAI platform and A2A are now compatible with the latest versions
- **OpenTelemetry** - Is more reliable and supports all modules in the framework (see our [Observability](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/observability) docs page). 

### RAG Module
- **Vector Store Tool** - Semantic search capabilities for any agent
- **Document Loader** - Support for multiple document formats
- **Text Splitter Backend** - Intelligent document chunking strategies
- **Dynamic Loading** - Load RAG components using configuration strings

See the [RAG](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/rag) docs page for more details.

## üîß Quality & Reliability Updates

### LLMs, Agents and Tools
- Enhanced MCP client session cleanup
- Add Google Gemini Backend Adapter
- Fixed streaming chunk processing for better real-time responses
- Enhanced tool choice validation and error messages
- Add cost tracking (part of the ChatModelOutput)
- Handle duplicated rules in RequirementAgent
- Improve the performance of the Handoff tool

## üó∫Ô∏è What's Coming Next

**Priorities:**
1. **Runnables Migration** - Major refactoring to the agents so that are easier to use, compose and build.
2. **Workflows V2** - Introducing a decorator-based, fully declarative approach to workflows
3. **Loader Module** - Configure frameworks' primitives with YAML (JSON) files
4. **Agent Consolidation** - Consolidate the agents into a single agent
5. **Built-in serving functionality**
