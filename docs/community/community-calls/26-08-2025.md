## üõ†Ô∏è Foundation Laid: Runnable Interface

We've implemented the core runnable interface that will standardize how components work across the entire BeeAI Framework!

### What We Built

The foundational `Runnable` abstract class and interface:

```python
class Runnable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def run(self, input: list[AnyMessage], /, **kwargs) -> Run[RunnableOutput]:
        pass
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def emitter(self) -> Emitter:
        pass
        
    @property
    def middlewares(self) -> list[RunMiddlewareType]:
        # Non-abstract - returns self._middlewares
        pass
```

### Current State

- ‚úÖ Core `Runnable` interface implemented
- ‚úÖ `RunnableOutput` and `RunnableOptions` defined
- ‚úÖ `@runnable_entry` decorator for execution context
- ‚è≥ **Next:** Implement interface in agents and workflows

**Foundation shipped in Release 0.1.36** ([PR #982](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/pull/982))

## üõ†Ô∏è Major Infrastructure Improvements

### Enhanced Backend Capabilities
- **Parallel Tool Calls Support** - Execute multiple tools simultaneously for better performance
- **Improved Serialization** - Better data persistence and transmission capabilities  
- **Memory Manager for Serving** - Streamlined memory handling for production deployments
- **Streaming Improvements** - Better chunk processing and error handling

### RAG Module Expansion
- **Vector Store Tool** - Semantic search capabilities for any agent
- **Document Loader** - Support for multiple document formats
- **Text Splitter Backend** - Intelligent document chunking strategies
- **Dynamic Loading** - Load RAG components using configuration strings

---

## üîß Quality & Reliability Updates

### Backend Improvements
- Fixed streaming chunk processing for better real-time responses
- Enhanced tool choice validation and error messages
- Improved Google Gemini adapter with better error handling
- Better cost tracking and propagation across models

### Developer Experience
- New snapshot testing with Syrupy for better test reliability
- Enhanced MCP client session cleanup
- Better handling of empty responses and edge cases
- Improved maintainer documentation

## üó∫Ô∏è What's Coming Next

**Priorities:**
1. **Runnable Implementation** - Apply the new interface to agents and workflows
2. **Workflows V2** - Introducing a decorator-based, fully declarative approach to workflows
3. **Loader Module** - Configure agents with YAML files for easier deployment
4. **Simplified Serving** - Streamlined platform deployment experience  
5. **Agent Consolidation** - Single unified `Agent` class to replace multiple agent types

---

## üí¨ Community Input Needed

- **Test the new Runnable interface foundation** - Help us design the agent/workflow integration
- **Share implementation feedback** - How should the interface work for your use cases?
- **Workflows V2** - Let us know your thoughts on [the proposal](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/discussions/1005)!
