## 🛠️ In Development: Runnable Interface

We're introducing a **unified runnable interface** that will standardize how components work across the entire BeeAI Framework.

### Current State

Different components had different APIs

```python
agent.run(input)
tool.execute(params)  
workflow.process(data)
```

### Future State

One consistent way to run agents, tools, and workflows.

### Key benefits

- Same patterns across all components
- Better type safety with clear input/output types for everything
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Components can be swapped easily
- Cleaner integrations

**Currently in PR #911 [draft]** - community feedback welcome!

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**Coming Next:**
1. **Loader Module** - Configure agents with YAML files
2. **Simplified Serving** - Easier platform deployment
3. **Agent Consolidation** - Single `Agent` class replaces multiple types
4. **Few-Shot Prompting** - First-class framework support
