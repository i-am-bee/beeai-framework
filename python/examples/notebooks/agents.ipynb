    "\n",
    "The BeeAI ReAct agent is a pre-configured implementation of the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern. It can be customized with tools and instructions to suit different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct pattern is a framework used in AI models, particularly language models, to separate the reasoning process from the action-taking process. This pattern enhances the model's ability to handle complex queries by enabling it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reason about the problem.\n",
    "- Decide on an action to take.\n",
    "- Observe the result of that action to inform further reasoning and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct agent provides a convenient out-of-the-box agent implementation that makes it easier to build agents using this pattern."

    "- Custom tooling: You can also write your own custom tools tailored to your specific use case.\n",
