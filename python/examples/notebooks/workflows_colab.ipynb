    "The goal of the BeeAI project is to make AI agents interoperable, regardless of their underlying implementation. The project consists of two key components:\n",
    "- **BeeAI Platform**: The platform to easily discover, run, and compose AI agents from any framework.\n",
    "- **BeeAI Framework**: A production-grade framework for building AI agents in either Python or TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed information on BeeAI can be found [here](https://beeai.dev/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's in this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn about BeeAI Workflows, which are available in the BeeAI Framework. An agent's behavior is defined through workflow steps and the transitions between them. You can think of a workflow as a graph that outlines an agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this notebook on [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/). The notebook uses **Ollama** to provide access to a variety of foundation models for remote execution. The notebook will run faster on Colab if you use the free *T4 GPU* option by selecting *Runtime / Change runtime type* in the Colab system menu."
