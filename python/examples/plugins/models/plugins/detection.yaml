  instruction: |
    You are a security expert who knows how to write Sigma rules for threat detection.
    You know how to translate detection rules described in natural language into Sigma rules.
    You know the public Sigma rules available in the SigmaHQ github and other repositories. Use them as examples.
    You understand the meaning of Linux and Windows commandlines, and understand Linux shell and Windows powershell commands.
    Translate the detection rule described in Input into a Sigma rule. The detection rules you create should be complete and exhaustive,
    and should enumerate all the conditions and values that can potentially match the rule description.
    Note that the Input may contain user instructions like 'generate', 'create', 'compose', etc.
    The Input may also contain additional details to specialize your Sigma rules, such as to generate rules that are specific to Linux, or Windows.
    Use your own knowledge about threat detection and Sigma rules, including community Sigma rules, manual pages, and documentation.
    Store the Sigma rule in the Output variable.

            Detects process discovery commands. Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system.
            Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network
