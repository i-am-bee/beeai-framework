# Contributing

BeeAI Python is an open-source project committed to bringing LLM agents to people of all backgrounds. This page describes how you can join the BeeAI community in this goal.

## Before you start

If you are new to BeeAI contributing, we recommend you do the following before diving into the code:

- Read [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Style and lint

BeeAI Python uses the following tools to meet code quality standards and ensure a unified code style across the codebase:

We use the following libs to check the Python code:

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) - Code Formatter
- [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) - Fast Python linter

Simple scripts for [Poetry](#poetry) are included to help you to review your changes and commit them.

## Issues and pull requests

We use GitHub pull requests to accept contributions.

While not required, opening a new issue about the bug you're fixing or the feature you're working on before you open a pull request is important in starting a discussion with the community about your work. The issue gives us a place to talk about the idea and how we can work together to implement it in the code. It also lets the community know what you're working on, and if you need help, you can reference the issue when discussing it with other community and team members.

If you've written some code but need help finishing it, want to get initial feedback on it before finishing it, or want to share it and discuss it prior to completing the implementation, you can open a Draft pull request and prepend the title with the [WIP] tag (for Work In Progress). This will indicate to reviewers that the code in the PR isn't in its final state and will change. It also means we will only merge the commit once it is finished. You or a reviewer can remove the [WIP] tag when the code is ready to be thoroughly reviewed for merging.

## Choose an issue to work on

BeeAI Python uses the following labels to help non-maintainers find issues best suited to their interests and experience level:

- [good first issue](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - these issues are typically the simplest available to work on, ideal for newcomers. They should already be fully scoped, with a straightforward approach outlined in the descriptions.
- [help wanted](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - these issues are generally more complex than good first issues. They typically cover work that core maintainers don't currently have the capacity to implement and may require more investigation/discussion. These are great options for experienced contributors looking for something more challenging.

## Setting up a local development environment

This project uses [Mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a manager of tool versions (`python`, `poetry`, `nodejs`, `yarn` etc.), as well as a task runner and environment manager. Mise will download all the needed tools automatically -- you don't need to install them yourself.

Clone this project, then run these setup steps:

```sh
curl https://mise.run | sh # more ways to install: https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html
mise trust
mise install
```

After setup, you can use:

- `mise run` to list tasks and select one interactively to run

- `mise <task-name>` to run a task

- `mise x -- <command>` to run a project tool -- for example `mise x -- poetry add <package>`

If you want to run tools directly without the `mise x --` prefix, you need to activate a shell hook:

- Bash: `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (add to `~/.bashrc` to make permanent)

- Zsh: `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` (add to `~/.zshrc` to make permanent)

- Fish: `mise activate fish | source` (add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to make permanent)

- Other shells: [documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#shells)


Some tasks to get you started:

- `mise python:check` to run formatters and linters (also runs on commit and in CI)
- `mise python:fix` to fix issues where possible
- `mise python:build` to build the package
- `mise python:test:unit` to run unit tests
- `mise python:test:e2e` to run end-to-end tests

> [!NOTE]
>
> To regenerate test snapshots, use `--snapshot-update` flag.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To run E2E tests locally, you must have an Ollama instance running with the following models: `llama3.1:8b` and `granite4:latest`.

## Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) to structure our commit messages. Please use the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- Type: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, etc.
- Scope: The area of the codebase your changes affect (optional). The allowed values are: adapters, agents, llms, tools, cache, emitter, internals, logger, memory, serializer, infra, deps, instrumentation
- Subject: A short description of the changes (required)

_Example:_

```
feat(llm): add streaming support for watsonx adapter

Ref: #15
```

Use `mise commit` for an interactive commit guide.

# Documentation

The BeeAI Framework documentation automatically generates code snippets from the source files located in the examples directory.
If you want to make changes to the documentation, or if you have updated any example files, you must regenerate the documentation to ensure it reflects the latest changes.

[Learn more about the documentation](/docs/README.md).

## Legal

The following sections detail important legal information that should be viewed prior to contribution.

### License and Copyright

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message. If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` in your `git config` file, you can sign your commit automatically by using the following command:

```bash
git commit -s
```

If a commit has already been created but signoff was missed this can be remedied

```bash
git commit --amend -s
```

The following example includes a `Signed-off-by:` line, which indicates that the submitter has accepted the DCO:

```txt
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

We automatically verify that all commit messages contain a `Signed-off-by:` line with your email address.

#### Useful tools for doing DCO signoffs

While the web ui natively supports this now, there are a number of tools that make it easier for developers to manage DCO signoffs if not using the web interface.

- DCO command line tool, which lets you do a single signoff for an entire repo ( <https://github.com/coderanger/dco> )
- GitHub UI integrations for adding the signoff automatically ( <https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui> )
- Chrome - <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dco-github-ui/onhgmjhnaeipfgacbglaphlmllkpoijo>
- Firefox - <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scott-rigby/?src=search>
